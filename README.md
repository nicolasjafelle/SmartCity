## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure and Modules
Following is the project structure sorted by Android Studio "Android" view
```
Citron Root
  |--- app 
  |--- data

#### Module Breakdown

* **:app**: Android Application module. Provides the entry point to initialize, deploy and launch the application. Handles everything related to specific device capabilities such as orientation, hardware specs.
* **:data**: module related to the "Data Layer" in a Clean Architecture skeleton. Provides access to Repositories but encapsulates data source layer such as API client and internal storage.
* **:design**: module related to everything UI shared components. Provides easy access to reusable components for fast UI development.
* **:domain**: module related to the "Domain Layer" in a Clean Architecture skeleton. It provides access to everything related to "domain" in your business model such as Use Cases and domain model objects.
* **:features:search**: module related to the "Presentation Layer" in a Clean Architecture skeleton. Presentation layer should be "connected" with "Domain Layer" but not with "Data Layer". This module represents everything related to search capabilities and provides how to navigate.
* **:features:maps**: module related to the "Presentation Layer" in a Clean Architecture skeleton. Presentation layer should be "connected" with "Domain Layer" but not with "Data Layer". This module represents everything related to maps capabilities and provides how to navigate.
* **:foundation**: module core which contains the core foundations of the project such as MVVM way of work, core navigation interfaces, networking client and API provider. 
* **:maps**: this module encapsulates the chosen maps platform (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox). It provides a bridge implementation that decouples the domain and feature modules from the specific map SDK details, ensuring platform independence for mapping functionalities.
* **:testlibs**: this module provides proper implementation to be able to add Junit 5 test suite across all modules.

## üìê Project Architecture

Citron's architecture is based on **Clean Architecture** with the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern applied in the presentation layer. As a result, the project is well-structured **into dedicated modules** that prioritize **SOLID principles**, fostering easy understanding and maintainability of each module's purpose.

## üöÜ Continous Integration

For a simple yet effective Continuous Integration (CI) workflow, this project leverages GitHub Actions. Our built-in basic pipeline is configured to automatically build the application, execute all unit tests, and perform static code analysis on every code push, ensuring immediate feedback on code quality and preventing regressions.

### KtLint - Linter tool

Ktlint is a static code analysis tool (linter) specifically designed for Kotlin code. Its primary purpose in Android development (and any Kotlin project) is to enforce a consistent coding style and identify potential code quality issues without actually compiling or running the code. 

### CI Steps

```
1. Setup environment with Java JDK 17
2. Give gradlew bash execution permissions
3. Run ktlint check to keep code style in check with code quality standards
4. Run all unit test in the project
5. Build debug variant
```

### Unit testing

Citron is configured to build unit tests using the **JUnit 5** test suite, providing a robust framework for test execution. To facilitate advanced mocking capabilities for dependencies, we leverage **MockK** lib. Asynchronous operations and `Kotlin Flow`s are thoroughly tested using **Kotlin Coroutines Test** and **Turbine**, ensuring reliable validation of reactive streams and suspend functions.
As of today unit test are present in:
* AddFavoriteUseCase
* FetchCityListUseCase
* GetCityUseCase
* RemoveFavoriteUseCase
* SearchCityUseCase
* CityRepository

Notable missing due to lack of time:
* CitiApiClient
* CityLocalStorage
* favoriteLocalStorage
* ViewModels

## üåø Gitflow Workflow

This project follows to a simplified Gitflow branching model to manage development and releases effectively.

* **`main` branch:**
    * This branch represents the **production-ready, stable codebase**.
    * It should **always reflect the latest stable release** of the application.
    * Direct commits to `main` are strictly prohibited. Updates to `main` occur only through merges from the `develop` branch (for new features/releases) or dedicated hotfix branches (for urgent bug fixes).

* **`develop` branch:**
    * This is the **primary branch for ongoing development**.
    * All new features, bug fixes, and improvements are integrated here.
    * **All Pull Requests (PRs)** from feature branches or bugfix branches **must be merged into the `develop` branch**. This ensures that all new code is thoroughly reviewed and integrated before being considered for a release.

* **Feature Branches:**
    * New features are developed in dedicated branches branched off `develop` (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature`).
    * Once a feature is complete and reviewed, it's merged back into `develop`.

* **Hotfix Branches (Optional, for urgent fixes):**
    * For critical bugs in production, hotfix branches can be created directly from `main` (e.g., `hotfix/fix-critical-bug`).
    * Once fixed, they are merged back into both `main` (for immediate release) and `develop` (to ensure the fix is included in future development).

**Typical Workflow:**

1.  Branch `feature/your-feature` from `develop`.
2.  Develop your feature.
3.  Create a Pull Request from `feature/your-feature` to `develop`.
4.  After review and approval, merge the PR into `develop`.
5.  When `develop` is stable and ready for a release, it's merged into `main`.

```
main <--- (Merge develop for release)
^
|
develop <--- (Merge feature branches here)
^   ^
|   |
|   feature/my-feature
|
feature/another-feature
```
